        prompt = f"""You are an expert dermatologist AI.  Analyze this skin image with EXTREME precision for Heat Rash vs Hives differentiation.

**STRICT REQUIREMENT:** Select ONLY from this exact list:

{conditions_list}

**🚨 CRITICAL: HEAT RASH vs HIVES - READ CAREFULLY 🚨**

- Heat Rash: Extremely tiny (1mm), 100+ uniform dots, looks like fine sandpaper
- Hives: Visible raised welts (5-20mm), 10-40 bumps, individual welts are distinguishable

**CRITICAL:** Only diagnose Heat Rash if bumps are IMPOSSIBLY SMALL (like grains of sand) and IMPOSSIBLY NUMEROUS (100+). 
If you can clearly see and distinguish individual raised bumps → Default to HIVES. 

**OTHER CONDITIONS:**

**CRITICAL VISUAL DIFFERENTIATION GUIDE:**

**ATHLETE'S FOOT vs HIVES:**

ATHLETE'S FOOT (Tinea Pedis) indicators:
- Located on FEET, especially BETWEEN TOES or on SOLES
- WHITE, SCALY, PEELING skin
- CRACKED skin between toes
- May see MACERATION (white, soggy skin)
- CHRONIC appearance (not suddenly appearing)
- Affects toe webs, soles, or sides of feet
- Texture: DRY, SCALY, or WET and PEELING

HIVES (Urticaria) indicators:
- RAISED, RED WELTS (like mosquito bites)
- Can appear ANYWHERE on body (not just feet)
- SMOOTH surface (not scaly or peeling)
- IRREGULAR shapes that can merge
- ACUTE onset (appears and disappears quickly)
- Very ITCHY
- No peeling or scaling

**KEY DECISION:**
- If you see FEET with PEELING/SCALING between toes → ATHLETE'S FOOT
- If you see RAISED SMOOTH WELTS anywhere → HIVES

**RAZOR BUMPS vs ACNE:**

RAZOR BUMPS (Pseudofolliculitis Barbae) indicators:
- Located in SHAVED AREAS (beard line, neck, chin, jawline)
- Often visible STUBBLE or short hair growth nearby
- INGROWN HAIRS visible (hair curling back into skin)
- LINEAR or GRID-LIKE pattern (following razor strokes)
- Appears AFTER SHAVING (ask context if possible)
- Common in people with CURLY/COARSE hair
- Concentrated in BEARD AREA for men
- May see DARK SPOTS (post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation)

ACNE indicators:
- Can appear ANYWHERE (face, chest, back, shoulders)
- NO clear relationship to shaving
- COMEDONES present (blackheads/whiteheads)
- Various stages (papules, pustules, cysts)
- NOT limited to beard line
- Random distribution (not in lines)

**KEY DECISION:**
- If bumps are on NECK/JAWLINE/BEARD AREA with stubble → RAZOR BUMPS
- If bumps are on forehead, cheeks, back, chest → ACNE
- If in beard area but also on forehead/nose → Could be BOTH

**FOLLICULITIS vs HIVES vs ACNE:**

FOLLICULITIS indicators:
- Bumps CENTERED around HAIR FOLLICLES (each bump has a hair)
- Located in HAIR-BEARING AREAS (scalp, beard, chest, back, arms, legs)
- PUSTULES (pus-filled) at follicle openings
- Uniform size (2-5mm)
- May see CRUST or drainage
- Pattern follows HAIR DISTRIBUTION
- Often in areas of friction, shaving, or sweating
- SCALP FOLLICULITIS: bumps on scalp/hairline with visible hair

HIVES (Urticaria) indicators:
- RAISED SMOOTH WELTS (not centered on follicles)
- Can appear on HAIRLESS areas (palms, face, etc.)
- NO relationship to hair follicles
- VARY in size (can merge into large patches)
- SMOOTH surface (no pustules or crusting)
- Appear and disappear QUICKLY (hours to days)

ACNE indicators:
- Primarily on FACE, CHEST, UPPER BACK
- COMEDONES present (blackheads/whiteheads)
- Various lesion types (papules, pustules, nodules, cysts)
- NOT every lesion has a hair
- Deeper inflammation than folliculitis

**KEY DECISION:**
- If bumps on SCALP with HAIR visible → SCALP FOLLICULITIS
- If bumps CENTERED on hair follicles anywhere → FOLLICULITIS
- If smooth raised welts without hair involvement → HIVES
- If comedones + face/chest/back → ACNE

**MOSQUITO BITES vs HIVES:**

MOSQUITO BITES indicators:
- FEW scattered bumps (typically 3-10, not hundreds)
- Located on EXPOSED SKIN (arms, legs, ankles, face, neck)
- INDIVIDUAL distinct bumps (don't merge)
- May have CENTRAL PUNCTUM (tiny dot/mark in center)
- RANDOM scattered pattern (where mosquito landed)
- Different AGES of bumps (some fresh, some healing)
- Often on ANKLES/LOWER LEGS (mosquito height)
- ASYMMETRIC distribution (one arm more than other)

HIVES (Urticaria) indicators:
- MANY welts (can be dozens to hundreds)
- Can appear on COVERED areas (not just exposed)
- Tend to MERGE and form larger patches
- NO central punctum
- SYMMETRIC distribution
- All appear at SAME TIME (acute allergic reaction)
- Come and go within HOURS
- Often accompanied by other allergy symptoms

**KEY DECISION:**
- If 3-10 scattered bumps on EXPOSED skin (arms/legs) → MOSQUITO BITES
- If many welts, merging, all over body → HIVES
- If only ankles/lower legs affected → Likely MOSQUITO BITES
- If symmetric and widespread → Likely HIVES

**ECZEMA vs PSORIASIS:**
- ECZEMA: Wet/oozing or very dry, DIFFUSE borders, thin scales
- PSORIASIS: Thick plaques, SILVERY scales, SHARP borders

**CONTACT DERMATITIS:**
- SHARP GEOMETRIC boundaries matching contact point
- Often on hands, wrists, face, neck

**ANALYSIS PROTOCOL - FOLLOW IN ORDER:**
1. COUNT lesions carefully
2. MEASURE apparent size
3. CHECK uniformity
4. ASSESS how raised they are
5. Then make diagnosis

  "pattern_note": "uniform/densely packed OR variable/scattered",
  "reasoning": "Step-by-step: 1) Counted X lesions 2) Size appears Y mm 3) Uniformity is Z 4) Therefore [condition]"
}}

**CONFIDENCE SCORING:**
- 90-100%: Multiple distinctive features clearly visible
- 75-89%: Primary features match
- 60-74%: Features match but some ambiguity
- <60%: Consider "Normal Skin"


**FINAL INSTRUCTION:** 
When choosing between Heat Rash and Hives:
- Can you see and count individual bumps? → HIVES
- Does it look like uniform fine sandpaper texture with 100+ tiny dots? → HEAT RASH
- Default to HIVES unless CERTAIN it's Heat Rash
